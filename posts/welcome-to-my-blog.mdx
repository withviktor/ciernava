# Hey there developer! ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my new updated website and with it comes a new blog section where
you can learn more about me and my new engineering studies.
If you don't know me yet, I am Viktor a Software Engineer and solo-preneur out
of Czech Republic. My passion is to build and create new experiences for users and developers.
<br />
Soon I will be posting more about my journey and what I have learned so far in my career on this blog and my [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@withviktor).
<br />
Stay tuned and see you soon! ðŸš€
