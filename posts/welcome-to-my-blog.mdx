# Hey there developer! ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my new updated website and with it comes a new blog section where you can learn more about me and my new engineering studies.

If you don't know me yet, I am Viktor a Software Engineer and solo-preneur out of Czech Republic. Be sure to check me out on [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/@withviktor), where I post about my day in a life of a solo developer and how I build my products from start to finish.
